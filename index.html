      <h2>Welcome to the GreenSpace Initiative</h2>
      <p>At GreenSpace Initiative, we believe nature is not a luxury â€” itâ€™s a necessity. As cities expand, so does concrete, asphalt, and heat. Our mission is simple but urgent: to transform urban environments by creating, preserving, and advocating for green spaces that reduce the urban heat island effect, improve public health, and build more resilient communities.</p>

      <h3>Why Green Spaces Matter</h3>
      <p>Cities are warming at an alarming rate due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Dense buildings, paved roads, and limited vegetation trap heat, pushing temperatures up by several degrees. This warming disproportionately affects low-income neighborhoods, contributes to air pollution, worsens public health outcomes, and increases energy costs.</p>
      <p>But thereâ€™s a solution â€” and itâ€™s greener than you think.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduce temperatures by providing shade and promoting evapotranspiration</li>
        <li>Improve air quality by absorbing pollutants and carbon dioxide</li>
        <li>Encourage physical activity and mental well-being</li>
        <li>Boost biodiversity and ecological balance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Green spaces are the most scalable, cost-effective, and beautiful way to cool our cities.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Our Vision</h3>
      <p>We envision a future where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Every child has access to a park within walking distance</li>
        <li>Every city includes green space in its zoning policies</li>
        <li>Green infrastructure is seen not as optional, but essential</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Through research, advocacy, education, and action, the GreenSpace Initiative is building momentum for a cooler, healthier tomorrow.</p>
