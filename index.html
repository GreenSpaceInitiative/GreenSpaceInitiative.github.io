      <h2>Welcome to GreenSpace Initiative</h2>
      <p>At GreenSpace Initiative, we believe nature is not a luxury — it’s a necessity. As cities expand, so does concrete, asphalt, and heat. Our mission is simple but urgent: to transform urban environments by creating, preserving, and advocating for green spaces that reduce the urban heat island effect, improve public health, and build more resilient communities.</p>

      <h3>Why Green Spaces Matter</h3>
      <p>Cities are warming at an alarming rate due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Dense buildings, paved roads, and limited vegetation trap heat, pushing temperatures up by several degrees. This warming disproportionately affects low-income neighborhoods, contributes to air pollution, worsens public health outcomes, and increases energy costs.

But there’s a solution — and it’s greener than you think.

Parks, trees, rooftop gardens, and green corridors don’t just look nice. They:

Reduce temperatures by providing shade and promoting evapotranspiration

Improve air quality by absorbing pollutants and carbon dioxide

Encourage physical activity and mental well-being

Boost biodiversity and ecological balance

Green spaces are the most scalable, cost-effective, and beautiful way to cool our cities.</p>

      <h3>Our Vision</h3>
      <p>We envision a future where:

Every child has access to a park within walking distance

Every city includes green space in its zoning policies

Green infrastructure is seen not as optional, but essential

Through research, advocacy, education, and action, the GreenSpace Initiative is building momentum for a cooler, healthier tomorrow.</p>

      <h3>Join Us in Making a Change</h3>
      <p>Whether you're an urban planner or a concerned citizen, there's a place for you in our mission.</p>
